Teamwork Assessment

The assignment brief will provide clear details on how your individual grade and feedback will be determined against the task and marking criteria. 
Importance of Word Count  
Assignment word counts should always be observed. Ignoring a word count significantly increases the risk of your work losing marks because it will likely lack focus and clarity, and/or you would have gained an unfair advantage over others who have completed their work within the word count.  
Students will be required to state their word count on all submissions. A 10% leeway will be allowed – so the maximum a student should submit will be the word count + 10%. The word count will exclude: 
o The title page 
o The contents page 
o Models, graphs, calculations, data tables, and other exhibited figures or images  
o Lists of references 
o Appendices (these should be kept to a minimum)
